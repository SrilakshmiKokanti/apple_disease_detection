# Apple Disease Detection
## Introduction
Welcome to the Apple Disease Detection project! This initiative is designed to help identify diseases in apple leaves using deep learning technology. By analyzing images of apple leaves, the system can classify them into one of four categories:
1. Black Rot
2. Cedar Apple Rust
3. Scab
4. Healthy
This tool is particularly useful for farmers, researchers, and agricultural experts looking to diagnose plant health efficiently.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?
This project includes:
1. A machine learning model trained on a dataset of apple leaf images.
2. A prediction script for testing individual images.
3. A user-friendly web app built with Streamlit for uploading images and getting instant results.

## About the Dataset
The dataset contains images of apple leaves categorized into four classes: Black Rot, Cedar Apple Rust, Scab, and Healthy. These images are organized into training and validation folders:

## Technologies Used
This project leverages several powerful tools and libraries:
### TensorFlow/Keras: 
For building and training the deep learning model.
### Streamlit: 
To create an intuitive web interface.
### NumPy: 
For numerical computations.
### OpenCV and Pillow: 
For image processing.
